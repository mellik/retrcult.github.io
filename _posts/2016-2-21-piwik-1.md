Statistics analysis
=========




User ID [†](http://piwik.org/docs/user-id/)
-------

If you are using the Tracker API directly you may set the User ID via the Tracker API parameter `&uid=USER_ID`.

Also, you can set a User ID in JavaScript:

{% highlight js %}
_paq.push(['setUserId', USER_ID_HERE]);
{% endhighlight %}

If you are using an API Client such as the **Android SDK** or the **PHP Client** then you may call the function `setUserId()` and as a parameter set a non empty User ID string.

Once you have implemented User ID you may segment your traffic based on the User ID value. See the `userId` segment in the [Segmentation Reference](http://developer.piwik.org/api-reference/segmentation).

Event Tracking [†](http://piwik.org/docs/event-tracking/)
-------

### Requesting Events report data

You may use the [Events API](http://developer.piwik.org/api-reference/reporting-api#Events) to request all data for Events, including any report combining **Event Categories**, **Event names** and **Event actions** (see `&secondaryDimension=` parameter)

### Tracking Events

To track an event, use the Javascript function `trackEvent()`:

{% highlight html %}
trackEvent( category, action, [name], [value] )
{% endhighlight %}

To track any user interaction or click, you can *manually call* the Javascript function `trackEvent()`. For example, if you wanted to track a click on a JavaScript menu, you could write:

{% highlight html %}
<a href="#" onclick="javascript:_paq.push(['trackEvent', 'Menu', 'View Similar Products', 'MenuClick']);">Similar Products</a>
{% endhighlight %}

You may also track numeric values for your event.

{% highlight js %}
_paq.push(['trackEvent', 'Documentary', 'Rating', 'Thrive', 9.5]);
{% endhighlight %}

Piwik reports for events will include the Total Event value, the Average event value as well as the Minimum and Maximum value, for each Event Category and each Event Name and each Event Action.

Content Tracking [†](http://developer.piwik.org/guides/content-tracking)
-------

* content impression:
  how often a specific ad or a banner was displayed
* content interaction:
  how often a visitor actually interacted with them

Once a page has loaded we log a content impression for each content block within that page which of each consists of

* a content name (My Product 1),
* a content piece (“product1.jpg” or “Buy Product 1 now”)
* a content target (http://landingpage.example.com).

As soon as a visitor *clicks* on a content block a content interaction is logged allowing you to analyze the ratio of content impressions to content interactions.

| Term                     | Purpose                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Content block            | A container which consists of a content name, piece and a target. |
| Content name             | A name that represents a content block. The name will be visible in reports. One name can belong to different content pieces. |
| Content piece            | The actual content that was displayed, e.g. a path to a video/image/audio file, a text, ... |
| Content target           | Where the user was led to after interacting with the content block. |
| Content impression       | Any content block that was displayed on a page. Optionally you can tell Piwik to track only impressions for visible content blocks. |
| Content interaction      | an interaction is happening when a visitor is interacting with a content block. It can be any interaction. |
| Content interaction rate | The ratio of content impressions to interactions. |



### Tracking Content

Mark each content block with a `data-track-content` HTML attribute or `piwikTrackContent` CSS class. Then activate content tracking by calling one of those two methods:

{% highlight js %}
_paq.push(['trackPageView']);

// To track all content blocks within a page.
_paq.push(['trackAllContentImpressions']);
// To track only visible content blocks within a page.
_paq.push(['trackVisibleContentImpressions', boolCheckOnSroll, intTimeIntervalInMs]);
// To track content impressions only for a part of the page
_paq.push(['trackContentImpressionsWithinNode', domNode]);
{% endhighlight %}

For a list of all available methods have a look at the [JavaScript Tracker reference](http://developer.piwik.org/guides/tracking-javascript-guide#content-tracking). Developers should have a look at the [in-depth guide on how to track content](http://developer.piwik.org/guides/content-tracking).

Use Content Tracking from any application or server, with the Tracking API. View the [Content Tracking HTTP API here](http://developer.piwik.org/api-reference/tracking-api).

#### Track an interaction semi-automatic

In case you want to trigger an interaction based on a form submit or a double click. To do so call the method `trackContentInteractionNode(domNode, contentInteraction)`.

{% highlight js %}
formElement.addEventListener('submit', function () {
  _paq.push(['trackContentInteractionNode', this, 'submittedForm']);
});
{% endhighlight %}

You should disable the automatic interaction tracking of that content block by setting the CSS class `piwikContentIgnoreInteraction` or the attribute `data-content-ignoreinteraction`. Otherwise an interaction might be tracked on top of it as soon as a visitor performs a click.

#### Tracking content impressions and interactions manually

You should use the methods `trackContentImpression()` and `trackContentInteraction()` only in conjunction together.

{% highlight js %}
_paq.push(['trackContentImpression', 'Content Name', 'Content Piece', 'http://www.example.com']);

div.addEventListener('click', function () {
  _paq.push(['trackContentInteraction', 'tabActivated', 'Content Name', 'Content Piece', 'http://www.example.com']);
});
{% endhighlight %}

Track content this way if you cannot easily change the markup of your site or if you want complete control over all tracked impressions and interactions.

Be aware that each call to those methods will send one request to your Piwik tracker instance. Doing this too many times can cause performance problems.
