In this project we experiment some simple combination of order and chaos that create a dynamic impressionistic flower.

<!--more-->

A particle system is set in a field defined by three dimensional attractor equations disturbed by random rotation. The chaotic system, sensitive to its parameters, as well as the audio inputs, creates curves and faces of one or more petals, which is symmetrically rotated around a periodically changing center and norm to create the flowers and other spherical shapes and colours that are constantly evolve in the space. We wish to show how simply spatial and temporal symmetry do work together with randomness and chaotic system to generate beauty.
